      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I am a self-taught programmer who knows Swift, Objective/Arduino C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, LaTeX, PHP, Ruby, and Bash/Shell.</p> <br />
      <p>I'm into iOS/WatchOS app and game development, so I joined the Apple Developer Program but many of my apps are open source, not published.</p> <br />
      <p>I have also created several apps, games, and clockfaces for Fitbit Versa smartwatches, some of which are open source on GitHub as well.</p> <br />
      <p>I am a full-stack web developer who has coded multiple websites, including this one, and has also made a custom device details plugin for YOURLS.</p> <br />
      <p>Other projects I have worked on include making two fun Discord bots and many math/science programs for TI-84 Plus CE calculators.</p> <br />
      <p>I’ve gotten into 3D printing/modeling with my Prusa, and while I am no expert at CAD, I have posted a few of my designs on Printables.</p> <br />
      <p>In my free time, I like to play the popular block-based videogame Minecraft, and I post primarily Minecraft videos on my YouTube channel.</p> <br />
      <p>Some of my other hobbies besides coding and Minecraft include playing the violin, traveling, photography, lacrosse, rickrolling, and reading.</p>
