## About
This is the official website of Sachin Agrawal, built using some simple HTML and CSS.

* It was originally hosted on a paid domain, which I eventually stop renewing.
* I then moved the site to Glitch, which offered free static site hosting.
* I have now migrated the site to GitHub Pages since Glitch ended support for sites.
